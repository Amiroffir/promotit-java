# PromotIt Java

PromotIt Java is a Java-based backend implementation of the PromotIt project, which was originally developed in C#. The
main objective of this project was to gain proficiency and hands-on experience with Java and its ecosystem technologies.
Additionally, the focus was on designing server and client components to be as independent as possible.

PromotIt is a web application designed to facilitate social promotion for non-profit organizations and related
campaigns. It aims to provide a platform for promoting social causes and managing campaigns effectively. You can find

The client-side of the application was built using Angular and was previously integrated with the original C# server.
